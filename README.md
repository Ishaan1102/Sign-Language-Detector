- Utilizes TensorFlow and MediaPipe for accurate gesture recognition.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Sign Language Detector on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishaan1102/Sign-Language-Detector.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd Sign-Language-Detector
```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To run the Sign Language Detector, execute the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python3 sign_language_detector.py
```

Ensure your webcam is connected and permitted to be used by applications. Follow the on-screen instructions to start detecting sign language gestures.
